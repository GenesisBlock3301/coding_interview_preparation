# What is Tree?
 A tree is a graph which is not contain any circle.
## Types of trees
 * <strong>Binary Tree: </strong> A binary tree is a tree which each node has up to two children.
 * <strong>Binary Search Tree: </strong> The binary search tree is an advanced algorithm used for analyzing the node, its left and right branches, which are modeled in a tree structure and returning the value.

## Complete Binary tree
A complete binary tree is binary tree which every level of the tree is
fully filled, except last level.But last level fill with left to right
not right to left.<br>

## Full Binary tree
Tree has either zero or two children. No nodes have only only one child.

## Perfect Binary tree
Trees has both full and complete children, all leaf node has same level. Perfect has 2^k - 1 node(where k number of level).
